'''Python collections - ang ARRAYS:

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

LIST is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
TUPLE is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
SET (ZBIÃ“R) is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
DICTIONARY is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.


When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type.
Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning,
and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
